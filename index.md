Hi there! My name is Nathan LaPierre, and I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). My expected graduation date is June 2022. After that, I will begin a postdoctoral position in August 2022.

My research interests lie in computational genetics and genomics. In particular, I am interested in using methods from causal inference, CRISPR screens, and functional genomics to elucidate causal mechanisms behind complex diseases. In the past (and sometimes present), I have worked on robust mendelian randomization, cross-population fine mapping, isoform-aware eQTL mapping, deep learning to improve nanopore read quality, and metagenomic profiling. For more details, see the links below.
