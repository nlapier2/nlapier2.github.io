Hi there! My name is Nathan LaPierre, and I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Medical Oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, working in the lab of Alexander Gusev.

I am a computational biologist and methods developer. My current research focuses on using deep generative models and single-cell data to make causal predictions of perturbation effects. In the past, I have worked on various problems in statistical genetics and genomics, including Mendelian randomization, fine mapping, deep learning for disease prediction, and metagenomics.

For more details, see the links below.
